# IPv6

Diep.io supports IPv6. This allows for a bypass of the two connetions per device limit without having the expense or latency of a VPN. Although IPv4 blocks are quite expensive, you can get 2^64 IPv6 addresses basically free.

1. Verify that you have IPv6 enabled here: https://test-ipv6.com/
2. Obtain a block of IPv6 addresses and map it to your computer
3. Set up your config file to include your IP block, a Discord bot token, and a prefix for the bot
4. Start `diep-bot/main.js`
